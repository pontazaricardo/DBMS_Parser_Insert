This is a DBMS project that creates DataTable objects based on standard SQL CREATE and INSERT queries.

## Usage

Just run the project in Visual Studio. The main form will then appear.

In this form you will see three main buttons:
1. **Load sample queries:** This button loads a set of sample queries that show how to use this DBMS.
2. **Execute queries:** This button executes whatever query is in the main window, and displays the result at the bottom.
3. **Clear main window:** This button clears all the instructions in the main window.
